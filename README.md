# Retinopathy-of-Prematurity
This AI-powered model revolutionizes early detection of Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP) in premature infants, offering faster, more accurate diagnoses to prevent vision loss and improve neonatal eye care. By leveraging deep learning, this system enhances screening accessibility, ensuring timely interventions and better outcomes for at-risk infants.

Techniques and Algorithms Used:
Deep Learning using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
Python with TensorFlow/Keras, OpenCV, NumPy, and Pandas
Image Processing & Classification for retinal image analysis
Project Overview:
In this project, I worked with retinal images of premature infants, preprocessing them for deep learning models. Using CNNs, I developed a system capable of detecting and classifying ROP stages, assisting in early diagnosis.

Result:
As early detection is crucial to preventing vision impairment, this project highlights how AI can assist healthcare professionals by providing faster and more reliable diagnoses. The model demonstrated strong potential in automating ROP screening, which is particularly beneficial in low-resource settings. The market for AI-driven ROP detection is expected to grow significantly, creating opportunities for scalable and cost-effective diagnostic solutions.
